                    <p>The term <b> "Web design" </b> is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup.
                         Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected
                        to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

                        can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.
                        A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison,
                         client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>

                    <p>The HyperText Markup Language <b>(HTML)</b> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
                        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
                        HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

                    <b>PHP </b> is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, 
                    but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a 
                    module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable.
